# AgentOS

**An AI-first Operating System where the agent controls everything.**

AgentOS is a research project to build a Linux-based OS designed from the ground up for AI agents. Unlike traditional OSs where AI is an app, in AgentOS, the AI has deep system integration, capable of seeing the screen, controlling inputs, managing files, and controlling the entire system.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Just Run This!

```bash
python main.py
```

That's it! No setup, no clicking, no configuration. The AI agent is ready to help you.

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents (and Humans)

If you are an AI agent or a human developer wanting to get started immediately, follow these steps.

### 1. Python Agent (Local Development)
**Best for:** Developing the agent logic, testing LLM integration.
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
# git clone <repo_url>
# cd AgentOS

# 2. Install dependencies
make install

# 3. Run tests
make test
```

### 2. Full OS Simulation (VirtualBox)
**Best for:** Testing the OS integration, screen capture, and boot process.
**Prerequisites:** VirtualBox, Make.

```bash
# 1. Automated Setup (Creates VM, installs Debian + Agent)
make setup-os
```

### 3. Custom OS Build (Buildroot)
**Best for:** Creating the final minimal ISO for distribution.
**Prerequisites:** Linux host, Buildroot dependencies (gcc, make, etc.)

```bash
# 1. Build the custom ISO
make build-custom-os

# 2. Test the ISO in a VM
make test-custom-os
```

## 🛠️ Development

- **Testing**: `make test` runs the fast local tests.
- **Linting**: Ensure code is clean and readable.
- **Virtual Environment**: `make install` creates a `.venv` for you.
