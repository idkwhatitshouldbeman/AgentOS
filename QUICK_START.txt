QUICK START - VM Setup
======================

1. DELETE OLD VM (if exists):
   In VirtualBox: Right-click "AgenticOS" → Remove → Delete all files

2. CREATE NEW VM:
   cd /home/aaroh/Downloads/AgentOS
   ./scripts/setup-vm-fast.sh

3. INSTALL DEBIAN:
   - Start VM in VirtualBox
   - Install Debian (minimal, no desktop)
   - Takes ~5-10 minutes

4. SETUP INSIDE VM:
   - Copy scripts/vm-post-install.sh into VM
   - Run it: chmod +x vm-post-install.sh && ./vm-post-install.sh

5. CREATE SNAPSHOT (from host):
   ./scripts/vm-snapshot-helper.sh create

DONE! Now testing is fast:
   make reset-vm    # Reset VM in 5 seconds
   make test-cycle  # Local tests + VM reset

See SETUP_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
