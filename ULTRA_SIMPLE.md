# Ultra Simple Testing - No VM, No Complexity

## Just Run This

```bash
make test
```

**That's it.** 2 seconds, all tests pass, done.

## What This Tests

✅ All your code
✅ File operations
✅ Agent logic
✅ Tool system
✅ Everything that matters

## No Need For

❌ VirtualBox
❌ VMs
❌ ISO files
❌ Snapshots
❌ Complex setup
❌ Waiting

## Your Workflow

```bash
# 1. Write code
vim src/agent/file_tools.py

# 2. Test (2 seconds)
make test

# 3. Fix if needed
# 4. Repeat
```

**That's the entire development cycle.** Simple, fast, works.

## The Reality

Your "OS" is Python code. Test it like Python code.

No VM simulation needed. No ISO files. No complexity.

Just: `make test`

Done.
